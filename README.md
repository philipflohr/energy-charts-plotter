# energy-charts-plotter
A python tool to convert data from the https://energy-charts.de homepage to pdf charts using matplotlib

For now only the production chart is supported

#Currently nonfunctional
**Since the relaunch of the website, this tool is non-fcuntional.**
It's likely easy to adapt to the new structure of the website. 
As the site is now offering an export functionality this adaptation will likely not be done - at least not by me. 
**Any contributions restoring the functionality are welcome.**
